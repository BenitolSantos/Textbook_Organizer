##### _Hey there, here is an example notes.md set up_ ðŸ˜Š

# App Summary
My app idea is _`Textbook Library`_. It will be a library that stores users and textbooks and the current_pages the users are on.

##### Below are the detailed specifications for the Rails Assessment. Try to answer them as best you can. Again, no worries if you arent sure on a particular item - We can talk about it together!

#### Specs:
- [x] Using Ruby on Rails for the project
  <br>

- [X] Include at least one has_many relationship
  * Example of one has_many relationship (e.g. x has_many y; User has_many books)
  <br>

- [X] Include at least one belongs_to relationship
  * Example of one belongs_to relationship (e.g. y belongs_to x; e.g. textbook belongs_to User)
  <br>

- [X] Include at least two has_many through relationships
  * Example of one belongs_to relationship (e.g. x has_many z through y; e.g. User has_many current_pages through textbook)
  <br>

- [X] Include at least one many-to-many relationship
  * Example of many to many relationship (e.g. x has_many y through z, y has_many x through z; (e.g. User has_many Categories through Posts, Categories has_many Users through Posts)
  <br>

- [X] The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable
  * attribute, that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user (think attribute_name e.g. post.title)
  <br>

- [X] Include reasonable validations for simple model objects
  * list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Post, Category (see above)
  <br>

- [X] Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (see user ticket method in rails amusement park)
  * model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. Category.most_posts URL: /categories/most_posts)
  <br>

- [X] Include signup (Remember bcrypt salt)
  <br>

- [X] Include login
  <br>

- [X] Include logout
  <br>

- [X] Include third party signup/login
  <br>

- [X] Include nested resource show or index (routes.erb 
  * URL e.g. categories/3/posts -> class/3/books/
  <br>

- [] Include nested resource "new" form ()
  * URL e.g. categories/7/posts/new)
  <br>

resourcesÂ :attractionsÂ doÂ 
Â Â resourcesÂ :rides
end

/attractions/1/rides/new <- just rides/new associated


- [X] Include form display of validation errors
  * form URL e.g. /posts/new)
  <br>

Confirm:
- [X] The application is pretty DRY (partials and layouts most def)
- [X] Limited logic in controllers
- [X] Views use helper methods if appropriate (scope method is a helper method)
- [X] Views use partials if appropriate

Optional:
Look into bootstrap and possibly add a little CSS
